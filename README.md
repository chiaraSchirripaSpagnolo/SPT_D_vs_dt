Impact of temporal resolution in single particle tracking analysis - code

1) In inputs.py set simulation inputs by changing the values of variables in the file.

2) Launch simulationMain.py. It will ask the number of simulations to run with the same set of parameters.
It saves spot positions and tracks also in .mat files

3) Create files of positions, tracks and movies readable by utrack. Run analysis on simulated tracks, simulated positions and simulated movies (details in "functionDescription.m")
